Quarter 1 Project Proposals:

Idea 1:

A working website for the law offices of Saul Goodman(the lawyer from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul).

While this is a fictional character, it solves the problem of those in need of legal counsel not having the representation they need. There are many fans of the show and the character and this would give them a chance to interact with him, and reach out to him for professional services.

I would include a landing page with a description of the business and several links to other pages including biography pages for the lawyers who work there, testimonials from other clients, and a game page.

The form will have client side validation for the user input and all the client information saved into local storage.

I will have javascript pages linked to my html pages with DOM manipulation and javascript functions to change the structure of the html based on user activity.

I will probably use a css framework, preferably bootstrap, and do some minor modifications with my own external CSS stylesheets.

I hope that I will not need to be a user of the website, because it would mean I have found myself on the wrong side of the law and might be in legal trouble.






















Idea 2:

A website with a catalog of professional basketball players and baseball players.

Users would be able to go to the site and see the top performers in their favorite sport.

This would let people relax and just spend some time reading up on their favorite athletes, and not worrying about the every day stresses of work and family and every day life.


Users would be able to input their information, including name, phone number, email address, and username, make sure itâ€™s validated on the client side, and have that saved into local storage.

I can also let users pick their favorite teams, and their favorite players and have that information saved into local storage.

I can also use DOM manipulation and javascript functions to have certain players and/or teams be eliminated from the users profile if they are not interested in reading about them.

Again I will probably use a CSS framework and then do some minor modifications with my own stylesheets linked externally.

I would be a user of this website because I am a big basketball and baseball fan and I already read sports sites like espn.com, mlb.com, nba.com and keep up to date on my favorite teams and players.
